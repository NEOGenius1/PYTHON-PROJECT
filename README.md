### EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS FOR AUTOMOBILE_BRAND ###

***EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:***

Using Python to clean and visualised the data, I created a dashboard to track the Vehicle_efficiency and how to maximise market opportunities
and other basic analysis that was to be deduced from this dataset. After I observe that fuel_type has huge impact on vehicle efficiency 
especially the vehicle that are using an hybrid system & for maximising market opportunities I recommend that the Manufacturers
should adopt the following steps to improve vehicle efficiency and maximise market opportunities.

*1.) ***OPTIMISE FUEL EFFICIENCY:*** Manufacturers should focus on hybrid system for improve fuel efficient especially the fuel_system and fuel_type*

*2.) ***TARGET PERFORMANCE-ORIENTED CUSTOMERS:*** Manufacturers should target customers who value high-performance Vehicles with specific 
characteristic such as "high_horse_Power" and "engine_type"*

***BUSINESS PROBLEM:***

Vehicle_Efficiency is very important for this AutoMobile Brand in other to be more competitive in the Market and drive sells of their Vehicle to 
customers satisfaction and The Manufacturers wanted to know the following

*1.) Better ways to improve their Vehicle Efficiency in other to stay ahead in the market when it comes to Vehicle_Efficiency and drive more Patronage*
*2.) They also want to know which demographics should they target for increase revenue and retention*

***METHODOLOGY***

*1.) I use Excel Powerquery to clean and unpivot the dataset to organise it well for analysis*

*2.) Visualised the data using Python Pandas, Matplotlib and seaborn and added extra columns for deeper analysis*

***SKILLS***
*Python: Pandas,Matplotlib, Seaborn, Visualising the dataset*

***BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS***

Visualising the data and creating charts to track Vehicle_efficiency and performance to give Manufacturers a clear picture into how
they can now be highly competitive in the Market place and deliver the type of Vehicle that meets their customer satisfaction and 
improve their revenue also improving their Vehicle Efficiency to stay ahead of the curve and also the make Makes with better Fuel_type

*1.) This analysis shows that each Vehicle makes and their cost, fuel_type and fuel_system.*
*2.) The analysis also show us the make with the highest number of Vehicle base on cost and horsepower etc.*

***NEXT STEP***

*The next step I recommend for the Business is to focus Hybrid system Vehicle more as it improve more efficiency and drive more sells*
